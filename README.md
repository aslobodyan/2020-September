# Andriy Slobodian's Test Task 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage
- Install `Node` + `NPM` + `Git` to your computer.
- `git init`
- `git clone git@github.com:aslobodyan/2020-September.git`
- `cd 2020-September`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Last command runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Some comments from me:
Original task is here: [`./src/assets/`](https://github.com/aslobodyan/2020-September/tree/master/src/assets)

I created separate component for each task (Please see [`./src/components/App/App.tsx`](https://github.com/aslobodyan/2020-September/tree/master/src/components/App) for details).

## How much time I spent?
I will not say that I did everything for half an hour. I really forgot `TypeScript` and I was in vacation during 2 previous months that is why there was a need to "refresh" my skills in it. So totally I spent nearly `6 hours` including time on writting this ;)
